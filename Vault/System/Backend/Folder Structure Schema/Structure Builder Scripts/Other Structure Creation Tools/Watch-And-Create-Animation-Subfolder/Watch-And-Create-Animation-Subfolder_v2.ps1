# üìú Usage Guide
# ===============================================
# Button set up:
# Right-click on Desktop > New > Shortcut
# Paste the path to this script in the location field:  
# C:\Users\benny\Dropbox\Family Room\√Ä FAIRE\02-√Ä Jouer\BEN\Watch-And-Create-Animation-Subfolder_v2.ps1
# Name the shortcut: "Start Folder Watcher"
# Optionally, set a custom icon for the shortcut.
# Right-click the shortcut > Properties > Change Icon
# Select an icon from the list or browse to a custom icon file.
# To run the script, double-click the shortcut. It will start monitoring the specified folder for new folders.
# When a new folder is created, it will automatically create a subfolder named "(animation)" within it.
# To stop the script, close the PowerShell window or press Ctrl+C in the PowerShell console.
# Yay! Now you can easily create an "(animation)" subfolder in any new folder you create in the specified path.



# ===============================================
# üõ° CONFIGURATION
# ===============================================
# Set the path to the folder you want to watch
$watchPath = "C:\Users\benny\Dropbox\Family Room\A FAIRE\02-A Jouer\BEN"

# Dry Run Mode:
# Set the dry run mode (true = no real folder creation, false = real folder creation)
# This is useful for testing the script without making any changes to your file system.
$dryRun = $true  # <<< CHANGE THIS TO $false to allow real folder creation
