The Vault learning journey flows through:

```plaintext

- 📝 Lessons → knowledge foundation.
    
- ❓ Quizzes → micro-feedback & early Nuggets.
    
- 🎯 Quests → applied learning & Nugget Rewards.
    
- 🏦 Nugget Bank → total Nugget & breakdown.
    
- 🪪 Player Profile → visualize growth & achievements.
    
- 🧭 Dynamic Recommendations → personalized next steps from advisors (Specialist, Generalist, Erratic).

```


## ⚙️ Core Elements

1. **[[🧑‍🏫 Lessons]]**  
	- Deliver structured knowledge on a topic or skill (linked to a [[Skill Tree]]).  
	- Contain explanations, examples, and best practices.  
	- Includes: 
	     - ❓ [[Micro-Quizzes]] → earn small Skill Nuggets for comprehension checks.
	     - 🎯 Linked [[🎯 Quests]] for applied practice.  
	    
2.  **[[🎯 Quests]]**  
	   - Offer practical challenges to apply [[Lesson]] knowledge.  
	   - Structured as:  
	     - 📝 **Instructions** (context, tools, resources)  
	     - 🛠 **Activity** (clear task, outcome)  
	   - Rewards: [[Skill Nuggets (SN)]] → accumulated in [[Skill Trees]].
		
3. [[Nugget Bank]]  
	- Tracks earned [[Nuggets]] by category.  
	- Feeds into [[Skill Trees]], [[Learning Recommendations]],  [[Milestone Badges]].
	
4. **Dynamic [[Learning Recommendations]]**  
	   - Suggest next Lessons and Quests based on Nugget balance, [[player profile]], and [[guidance mode (Generalist, Specialist, Erratic)]].
	
5. **[[Player Profile]] & Dashboard**
	   - Tracks progress, skills, milestones, and quest history.

## 📝 Key Design Principles

- **Multiple [[Skill Trees]] per [[Nugget]]:**  
    Nuggets can contribute to more than one Skill Tree when applicable (e.g., a Bash script could earn both Bash and Automation Nuggets).
    
- **Flexible, Organic Growth:**  
    Users can specialize in certain trees or maintain generalist growth across all.
    
- **Visual Tracking:**  
    [[Nugget]] icons appear in [[Bank]] dashboards and Player Profiles for intuitive recognition.
    
- **Milestones & Badges:**  
    As [[Nuggets]] accumulate, milestones trigger [[badge awards]] within each Skill Tree.
