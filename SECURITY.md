# 🛡️ Security Policy

Welcome to the Awesome Test Vault!  
This is a creative and educational space built on care, clarity, and integrity.

While the Vault is not a traditional software repository, it includes structured systems, logic templates, metadata patterns, and public-facing documentation — all of which deserve thoughtful security and privacy considerations.

---

## 🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability — such as a template logic flaw, metadata exposure, or any concern that could impact a contributor’s data organization, privacy, or experience — please report it privately.

You can report issues through either of these methods:

- Open a [confidential GitHub Issue](https://github.com/PtiCalin/Awesome-Test-Vault/issues/new/choose)  
- Contact the maintainer via GitHub’s contact button

**Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities** without first allowing time for review and resolution.

## 🔐 What Counts as a Security Issue?

Security issues in the Vault may include:

- Sensitive or personal data mistakenly exposed in templates or notes  
- Logic flaws in workflows that compromise structure or user control  
- Plugin usage advice that could lead to data loss or vault corruption  
- Unintended metadata leaks through automated systems

When in doubt, it’s always okay to check in — better cautious than compromised.

- Reviewing all security reports with care  
- Maintaining respectful and transparent communication  
- Taking timely corrective action (patches, documentation, or workflow fixes)
